/*    Given these three types of tests (navigatingToPages, clickingButtons, and playingVideo)
       and a list of metadata objects (each corresponding to a functional test for HBO Go),
       write a function or functions that answer the follow questions: 
    
       - Do we have full coverage? 
         (ie. Does a passing test exist for each of the three test types for all designs)
      
       - If not, what's missing?  
     
       - Do we have any overlapping tests? 
         (ie. Is any of the three tests being checked for a design more than once?)  
         
         
         Notes: design 'univ' means desktop, android, and ios.
                design 'mobile' means android and ios.

/*
      Answer: Yes there is full coverage, but there is an overlap for playingVideo with design ios.
